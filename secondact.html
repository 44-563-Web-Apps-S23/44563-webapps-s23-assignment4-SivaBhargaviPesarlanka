                Seen through an oval frame, one of the walls of a parlor. The
     wall-paper is a conventionalized pattern. Only the shelf of the
     mantelpiece shows. At each end, seated on pedestals turned slightly
     away from one another, two aristocratic bisque figures, a boy in
     delicate cerise and a girl in cornflower blue. Their shadows join
     in a grotesque silhouette.

To begin with--<br>
I dislike, suspect, deplore--<br>
I had best say, feel compassion<br>
for what is called humanity--<br>
or the animate, as opposed to the inanimate----</p>
                
<p class = "Speech"></p> <h6 class = "SHE" >SHE.</h6>
<p>You say that so wisely--t<br>
you're such a philosopher--<br>
say it again!</p>

<p class = "Speech"></p> <h6 class = "HE" >HE.</h6>
<p>Your doubt--which doubt, what doubt?<br>

<p class = "Speech"></p> <h6 class = "SHE" >SHE.</h6> 
<p>And although I can't move, although I can't move unless somebody<br>
shoves me, one of these days when the sun isn't here, I would have<br>
slipped over the edge of this everlasting shelf----</p>

<p class = "Speech"></p> <h6 class = "HE" >HE.</h6>
<p> Minikin!</p>

<p class = "Speech"></p> <h6 class = "SHE" >SHE.</h6>
<p> And fallen to that everlasting floor into so many fragments, they'd<br>
never paste Minikin together again!</p>
