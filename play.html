                Seen through an oval frame, one of the walls of a parlor. The
     wall-paper is a conventionalized pattern. Only the shelf of the
     mantelpiece shows. At each end, seated on pedestals turned slightly
     away from one another, two aristocratic bisque figures, a boy in
     delicate cerise and a girl in cornflower blue. Their shadows join
     in a grotesque silhouette.

To begin with--<br>
I dislike, suspect, deplore--<br>
I had best say, feel compassion<br>
for what is called humanity--<br>
or the animate, as opposed to the inanimate----</p>
                
<p class = "Speech"></p> <h6 class = "SHE" >SHE.</h6>
<p>You say that so wisely--t<br>
you're such a philosopher--<br>
say it again!</p>

<p class = "Speech"></p> <h6 class = "HE" >HE.</h6>
<p>Your doubt--which doubt, what doubt?<br>

<p class = "Speech"></p> <h6 class = "SHE" >SHE.</h6> 
<p>And although I can't move, although I can't move unless somebody<br>
shoves me, one of these days when the sun isn't here, I would have<br>
slipped over the edge of this everlasting shelf----</p>

<p class = "Speech"></p> <h6 class = "HE" >HE.</h6>
<p> Minikin!</p>

<p class = "Speech"></p> <h6 class = "SHE" >SHE.</h6>
<p> And fallen to that everlasting floor into so many fragments, they'd<br>
never paste Minikin together again!</p>

<p class = "Speech"></p> <h6 class = "HE" >HE.</h6>
<p>Minikin, Minikin!</p>

<p class = "Speech"></p> <h6 class = "SHE" >SHE.</h6>
<p> Because of my doubt--because I'm as positive as I am that I sit<br>
here with my knees in a knot--that that human creature--loves you.</p>

<p class = "Speech"></p> <h6 class = "HE" >HE.</h6>
<p>That which is able to move<br>
can never be steadfast, you understand?<br>
Let us consider the creature at hand<br>
to whom you have referred<br>
with an undue excess of admiration<br>
adulterated with an undue excess of envy----</p>

<p class = "Speech"></p> <h6 class = "SHE" >SHE.</h6>
<p>I'm sufficiently feminine--and certainly old enough--I and my<br>
hundred and seventy years--I can see, I can feel by her manner of<br>
touching me and her flicking me with her mop--the creature hates<br>
me--she'd like to drop me, that's what she would!</p>

<p class = "Speech"></p> <h6 class = "HE" >HE.</h6>
<p>Minikin!</p>

<p class = "Speech"></p> <h6 class = "SHE" >SHE.</h6>
<p>Don't you venture defending her! Booby--you don't know live women!<br>
When I'm in the right position I can note how she fondles you, pets you<br>
like a parrot with her finger-tip, blows a pinch of dust from your eye<br>
with her softest breath, holds you off at arm's length and fixes you<br>
with her spider look, actually holds you against her cheek--her<br>
rose-tinted cheek--before she releases you! If she didn't turn us apart<br>
so often, I wouldn't charge her with insinuation; but now I know she<br>
loves you--she's as jealous as I am--and poor dead me in her live power!<br>
Manikin? */</p>

<p>Recall our childhood in the English museum--<br>
ere we were moved,<br>
from place to place,<br>
to this dreadful Yankee salon--<br>
do you remember<br>
that little old Greek tanagra<br>
of the girl with a head like a bud--<br>
that little old Roman medallion<br>
of the girl with a head like a----</p>

<p> Manikin, Manikin--<br>
were they so beautiful as I--<br>
did you love them, too--<br>
why do you bring them back?</p>

<p class = "Speech"></p> <h6 class = "HE" >HE.</h6>
<p class = "Speech">They were not so beautiful as thou--<br>
I spoke of them--<br>
recalled, designated them--<br>
well, because they were ages old--<br>
and--and----</p>

<p class = "Speech"></p> <h6 class = "SHE" >SHE.</h6>
<p>If you could see me the way you see her, you'd still love me, you'd<br>
love me the way you do her! Who made me what I am? Who dreamed me in<br>
motionless clay?</p>
